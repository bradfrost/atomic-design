This is a paragraph, **which can even have bolded text**. _It can also have italicized text_ if you're feeling saucy. What about links? Believe it or not, [we can put links on our web pages](#). What a wonderful world we live in.

## This is a second-level heading

- Here is a bulleted list.
- I love bulleted lists.
- Sometimes the text in a bulleted list can wrap onto multiple lines so it's important to show what that looks like.
- This is the last bulleted list items.

### This is a third-level heading

Hey! Here comes a blockquote!

> A block quotation (also known as a long quotation or extract) is a quotation in a written document, that is set off from the main text as a paragraph, or block of text, and typically distinguished visually using indentation and a different typeface or smaller size quotation. <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_quotation)</cite>

Profound, eh?

#### This is a fourth-level heading

Let's take a look at ordered lists now.

1. Step 1: make an ordered list.
2. Step 2: add some ordered list items.
3. Step 3: Show what longer passages of text look like within an ordered list because that seems like a smart thing to do.
4. Step 4: Let's wrap this thing up.

##### This is a fifth-level heading

Are you ready for code? How about `inline code` blocks? Want to see a code block?! Yeah!?

````````html
<coooooodddddeee>
    <h1 class="code-h1">This is code!</h1>
    <p>Holy crap!</p>
</coooooodddddeee>
````````

And that's the style guide. Fun fun fun.
