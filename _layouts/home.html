				We're tasked with making interfaces for more users in more contexts
				using more browsers on more devices with more screen sizes and more
				capabilities than ever before. That's a daunting task indeed.
				Thankfully, design systems are here to help.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Atomic Design</em> details all that goes into creating and
				maintaining robust design systems, allowing you to roll out higher
				quality, more consistent UIs faster than ever before. This book
				introduces a methodology for thinking of our UIs as thoughtful
				hierarchies, discusses the qualities of effective pattern libraries, and
				showcases techniques to transform your team's design and development
				workflow.
