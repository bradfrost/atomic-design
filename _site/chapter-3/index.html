    <div class="note">
	<p>Greetings, reader! The following text is a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-design-book/">work in progress</a> so be warned you will encounter incomplete thoughts, grammar errors, and more. If you see something worth fixing, please <a href="https://github.com/bradfrost/atomic-design">submit an issue on Github</a>. Thanks and happy reading!</p>
</div>
    <p>In the last chapter, I introduced the atomic design methodology for constructing user interfaces. Hopefully you’ll find atomic design to be a helpful mental model for constructing UI design systems, but now it’s time to climb down from the ivory tower and actually put atomic design into practice <em>in the real world</em>.</p>

<p>The cornerstone of pattern-based design and development is the pattern library, which serves as a centralized hub of all the UI components that comprise your user interface. As we discussed in Chapter 1, the benefits of pattern libraries are many:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They <strong>promote consistency and cohesion</strong> across the entire experience.</li>
  <li>They <strong>speed up your team’s workflow</strong>, saving time and money.</li>
  <li>They <strong>establish a more collaborative workflow</strong> between all disciplines involved in a project.</li>
  <li>They <strong>establish a shared vocabulary</strong> between everyone in an organization, including outside vendors.</li>
  <li>They <strong>provide helpful documentation</strong> to help educate stakeholders, colleagues, and even third parties.</li>
  <li>They <strong>make cross-browser/device, performance, and accessibility testing easier</strong>.</li>
  <li>They <strong>serve as a future-friendly foundation</strong> for teams to modify, extend, and improve upon over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>That all sounds wonderful, right? I can almost hear you saying, “I need this whole pattern library thing in my life.” But how do we make pattern libraries happen? Well, you’ve come to the right place, friend, because the rest of this book is dedicated to exactly that. This chapter will introduce helpful tools for creating pattern libraries, and the following chapter will discuss how to make patterns a cornerstone of your design and development workflow. </p>

<p>I’ll be talking about the qualities of effective pattern libraries through the lens of a tool called <a href="http://patternlab.io">Pattern Lab</a>, an open-source project created by me and <a href="http://dmolsen.com">Dave Olsen</a> to execute atomic design systems. While I’ll excitedly discuss Pattern Lab and its various features, I want to stress that the point of this chapter is to cover the characteristics of well-constructed pattern libraries, not sell any one specific tool to you. Hell, Pattern Lab isn’t even for sale! No single tool will be a perfect fit for all readers, but be sure to keep the following principles in mind when deciding what tools to use to create your pattern libraries.</p>

<h2 id="just-what-exactly-is-pattern-lab">Just what exactly is Pattern Lab?</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the nuts and bolts of how Pattern Lab works, it’s important to take time to explain what the tool is and isn’t.</p>

<h3 id="pattern-lab-is">Pattern Lab is…</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a static site generator tool for building atomic design systems.</li>
  <li>a pattern documentation and annotation tool.</li>
  <li>a pattern starter kit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pattern-lab-isnt">Pattern Lab isn’t…</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a UI framework like Bootstrap or Foundation.</li>
  <li>language, library, or style dependent.</li>
  <li>a replacement for a content management system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s walk through these points, starting with the term <em>static site generator</em>. Static site generator tools take in some source code &amp; assets, compile them, and spit plain-ol’ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript out the other end. <strong>Pattern Lab takes source code – namely patterns – and compiles those patterns into a functional front-end UI inside a pattern library shell</strong>.</p>

<p>So what does Pattern Lab look like out of the box? Drumroll, please. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/pattern-lab-default.png" alt="The default Pattern Lab dashboard. What it lacks in good looks, it makes up for in utility." />
	<figcaption>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Not a terribly inspiring design, eh? Believe it or not, this minimal (one may even say “lack of”) design is deliberate. To avoid incorrect classification as a UI framework like Bootstrap, the design is deliberately stripped down so no one would mistakenly use Pattern Lab’s demo UI as suggested styles. Pattern Lab doesn’t give you any answers as to how to design or architect your front-end code; <em>you have to do all that work yourself.</em> The look &amp; feel, naming conventions, syntax, structure, libraries, and scripts you choose to use to create your UI is entirely up to you. Heck, you can even use UI frameworks like Bootstrap within Pattern Lab. Pattern Lab is just there to help stitch everything together.</p>

<p>As a technical aside, Pattern Lab uses PHP as the engine that stitches patterns together and generates the pattern library. However, you don’t need to be a PHP wizard to use Pattern Lab any more than you have to know how to build an internal combustion engine in order to drive a car. Moreover, your final website doesn’t have to be built with PHP in order to use the tool, as Pattern Lab’s output is backend-agnostic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But if you’re one of those cool kids who thinks using a PHP-based tool will somehow ruin your reputation, there’s also a <a href="https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node">Node.js version</a> thanks to web developer <a href="http://www.brianmuenzenmeyer.com/">Brian Muenzenmeyer</a>. </p>

<p>If that all sounded like gibberish to you, don’t worry. This chapter focuses on the over-arching features and principles behind Pattern Lab rather than going too far down the technical rabbit hole. You can check out <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/index.html">Pattern Lab’s documentation</a> to dive into the nitty gritty.</p>

<h2 id="building-atomic-design-systems-with-pattern-lab">Building atomic design systems with Pattern Lab</h2>
<p>In order to understand the core concept behind Pattern Lab, you need to understand Russian nesting dolls. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/russian-nesting-dolls.jpg" alt="Russian nesting dolls. &lt;a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/tromal/6901848291/'&gt;via Flickr user Tromal&lt;/a&gt;" />
	<figcaption>
	    Russian nesting dolls. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tromal/6901848291/">via Flickr user Tromal</a>
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Matryoshka dolls, also known as Russian nesting dolls, are beautifully-carved hollow wooden dolls of increasing size that are placed one inside the other. Patterns in Pattern Lab operate in a similar manner: the smallest patterns (atoms) are included inside bigger patterns (molecules), which are included in even bigger patterns (organisms), which are in turn included in even bigger patterns (templates). </p>

<p>Constructing UIs in this manner helps keeps things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, which is a long-standing computer science principle that stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself.” Make a change to a pattern, and anywhere that pattern is employed will magically update with those changes. This saves an extraordinary amount of time and grief, and certainly beats the pants off sifting through hundreds of Photoshop documents for every instance of a pattern just to make a simple change.</p>

<p>To make this happen Pattern Lab uses the <em>include</em> feature of <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>, a logic-less templating language. Here’s what a Mustache include looks like:</p>

<pre>
<code>
{{&gt; atom-thumbnail }}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is Mustache code, in case the double curly braces (<code>{{}}</code>) that look like little mustaches didn’t give it away. The greater than symbol (<code>&gt;</code>) is Mustache’s way of telling Pattern Lab “hey, I want you to include an atom pattern called “thumbnail”. Pattern Lab will go searching through its folders of patterns to find an atom named “thumbnail”.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/pattern-lab-file-structure.png" alt="This is what Pattern Lab's default patterns folder structure looks like. You can name and categorize these folders however you'd like, even removing the labels 'atoms', 'molecules', and 'organisms'. The most important consideration is to establish naming &amp; categorization that is most clear for your team." />

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now that we know what an include looks like, let’s put it into practice and take a look at a few patterns from a website I helped make for Time Inc. Here’s one reusable pattern we designed:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/pattern-lab-molecule.png" alt="For Time Inc.'s website, we created a basic block pattern consisting of a thumbnail image, headline, and excerpt." />
	<figcaption>
	    For Time Inc.'s website, we created a basic block pattern consisting of a thumbnail image, headline, and excerpt.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This pattern should look fairly familiar. A thumbnail image, headline, and excerpt working together as a single unit is a common pattern found on countless websites. Let’s take a peek behind the curtain to see how this pattern is constructed:</p>

<p><em>[<small>Note from Brad: Forgive the mess with the markup formatting. I need to look into how to properly escape characters and highlight syntax in a way that works for the site but also for the eventual ebook.</small>]</em></p>

<pre>
<code>

\&lt;div class="block-post"\&gt;
    \&lt;a href="{{ url }}"\&gt;
        {{&gt; atoms-thumb }}
        \&lt;h3\&gt;{{ headline }}\&lt;/h3\&gt;
       \&lt;p\&gt;{{ excerpt }}\&lt;/p\&gt;
    \&lt;/a\&gt;
\&lt;/div\&gt;

</code>
</pre>

<p>You can see we have HTML markup consisting of a wrapper <code>div</code> with a class name of <code>block-post</code>, a link, a Mustache include for the thumbnail image, a <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tag for the headline, and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag for the excerpt. You’ll notice there’s more Mustache code for <code>url</code>, <code>headline</code>, and <code>excerpt</code>, which we’ll use later to dynamically swap in actual content. More on that in a bit.</p>

<p>Now that we have our pattern markup established, we can now include that chunk of code in even bigger patterns using the same include method:</p>

<pre>
<code>
{{&gt; molecules-block-post }}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now let’s move up to more complex organisms like the website’s header, which looks a little something like this:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/organism-timeinc-header.png" alt="The website header consists of fairly common conventions like a logo atom, primary navigation molecule, and a search form molecule." />
	<figcaption>
	    The website header consists of fairly common conventions like a logo atom, primary navigation molecule, and a search form molecule.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When we crack open the hood to look at the header’s markup in Pattern Lab, we see the following:</p>

<pre>
<code>

\&lt;header role="banner"\&gt;
    {{&gt; atoms-logo }}
    {{&gt; molecules-primary-nav }}
    {{&gt; molecules-search }}
\&lt;/header\&gt;

</code>
</pre>

<p>What’s going on here? Well, we have a basic <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag, and inside that tag we’re including the logo image atom, the primary navigation molecule, and the search form molecule.</p>

<p>And now we can include that relatively complex pattern anywhere we need it.</p>

<pre>
<code>
{{&gt; organisms-header }}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Hopefully by now you can see the Russian nesting dolls taking shape. The smallest atoms are included in bigger molecules, and those molecules get included in even bigger organisms. Now let’s take these components and plug them into a layout. Take the homepage template, for instance:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/template-timeinc-homepage-long.png" alt="The Time Inc. homepage template consists of a few repeatable patterns: a global header, a hero area, a few sections (containing an image, headline, excerpt, and call to action), an area featuring four items, a 'factoid' area, and a global footer." />
	<figcaption>
	    The Time Inc. homepage template consists of a few repeatable patterns: a global header, a hero area, a few sections (containing an image, headline, excerpt, and call to action), an area featuring four items, a 'factoid' area, and a global footer.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Take a quick stroll through the homepage template and you’ll see some pretty standard patterns: a site header at the top, a site footer at the bottom, and a full-screen hero area. You’ll also see a few other patterns repeating themselves throughout the template. </p>

<p>So how does this look in code? As you might expect, it involves more includes!</p>

<pre>
<code>

{{&gt; organisms-header }}
\&lt;main role="main"\&gt;
    {{# hero }}
    {{&gt; molecules-hero }}
    {{/ hero }}
    \&lt;section\&gt;
        {{# experience-block }}
        {{&gt; molecules-block-main }}
        {{/ experience-block }}
        {{# experience-feature }}
        {{&gt; organisms-story-feature }}
        {{/ experience-feature }}
    \&lt;/section\&gt;
    \&lt;section\&gt;
        {{# factoid-advertising }}
        {{&gt; organisms-factoid }}
        {{/ factoid-advertising }}
    \&lt;/section\&gt;
    \&lt;section\&gt;
        {{# advertising }}
        {{&gt; molecules-block-main }}
        {{/ advertising }}
    \&lt;/section\&gt;
    …   
  \&lt;/main\&gt;
  {{&gt; organisms-footer }}
\&lt;/div\&gt;

</code>
</pre>

<p>At this stage in the game the smaller patterns are already constructed, so all the template needs to do is pull them into the context of a page layout and give them unique names.</p>

<p>Taking a closer look at the code, notice certain patterns like <code>{{&gt; organisms-header }}</code> and <code>{{&gt; organisms-footer }}</code> are included the same way we’ve done with the prior examples. But there are also a few other includes patterns that are supplemented by some additional information, like the following:</p>

<pre>
<code>

{{# factoid-advertising }}
{{&gt; organisms-factoid }}
{{/ factoid-advertising }}

</code>
</pre>

<p>We’re including <code>organisms-factoid</code> the same way as all the other patterns, but we’re also naming it <code>factoid-advertising</code> by wrapping the include in a mustache <em>section</em>, indicated by the mustache code containing the <code>#</code> and <code>/</code> symbols.  By giving the pattern instance a unique name, we can latch onto it and dynamically replace the content of the pattern. More on that in the next section!</p>

<p>This Russian nesting doll approach to building UIs is simple but tremendously powerful. This structure allows designers and developers to keep patterns DRY saving time, effort, and money.  This approach also allows teams to build a final UI while simultaneously creating the underlying UI design system.  After all, the final interface is one instantiation of its underlying design system. Teams can also traverse between abstract and concrete, zeroing in on a particular pattern to fix bugs (“The header’s broken!”), while also seeing how changes to small patterns affect the overall page layout.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-dynamic-data">Working with dynamic data</h2>
<p>It’s important to articulate the underlying content structure of UI patterns within the context of a pattern library. That’s why we’ve been looking at dimension-displaying grayscale images and placeholder text containing character limits. But while this information is helpful for creative teams, grayscale images and lorem ipsum text are not what end users interact with on your actual site. We need a way to replace our default dummy content with real representative content in order to ensure our UI patterns match the reality of the content that lives inside them.</p>

<p>To demonstrate how Pattern Lab dynamically swaps in real content into templates, let’s take a look at a side-by-side comparison of Time Inc.’s homepage template and page levels:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/timeinc-template-page.png" alt="A side-by-side comparison of Time Inc.'s homepage template and page levels. The template articulates the content structure of the design system, while the page shows what the system looks like with real content poured into it." />
	<figcaption>
	    A side-by-side comparison of Time Inc.'s homepage template and page levels. The template articulates the content structure of the design system, while the page shows what the system looks like with real content poured into it.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the left we have the template level, which articulates the content structure of the patterns making up the webpage. And on the right we have the page level, where we’re pouring in real representative content to demonstrate what the final UI might look like and test the effectiveness of the design system. </p>

<p>So how do we swap dummy content for real content in Pattern Lab? Pattern Lab uses JSON (as well as YAML, Markdown, and other data formats) to define and swap out the dynamic bits of content in our designs.</p>

<p>The default placeholder data is defined in a file called <code>data.json</code> that lives in Pattern Lab’s <code>source</code> directory. Inside this file we define all the text, image paths, and other dynamic data that will make up our UI. Here’s a small sample from Time Inc.’s <code>data.json</code> file:</p>

<pre>
<code>

"hero" : {
  "headline": "Lorem Ipsum",
  "img": {
    "src": "/images/sample/fpo_hero.png",
    "alt": "Hero Image"
  }
}

</code>
</pre>

<p>For developers, this type of format most likely looks familiar. If you’re not a developer, don’t freak out! Once you look beyond the curly braces and quotes, you’ll see that we’re defining a <em>hero</em> object (for the full-bleed hero area directly below the header) that has a <em>headline</em> value of “Lorem Ipsum” and an <em>img</em> with a <em>src</em> value of “/images/sample/fpo_hero.png”. We’re simply defining this object’s attributes and values for those attributes.</p>

<p>Once those objects are defined, then we can override their attributes at Pattern Lab’s page level. This is accomplished by creating a new JSON file that matches the page pattern name (for Time Inc.’s homepage, we’ll call it <code>homepage.json</code>) inside the <code>pages</code> directory. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/timeinc-page-directory.png" alt="Inside the 'pages' directory we have the homepage pattern as well as a JSON file that matches the name of the pattern. This is where we'll override the default content with page-specific content." />
	<figcaption>
	    Inside the 'pages' directory we have the homepage pattern as well as a JSON file that matches the name of the pattern. This is where we'll override the default content with page-specific content.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When we open up <code>homepage.json</code> we can override the placeholder data we established earlier. Here’s what that might look like:</p>

<pre>
<code>

"hero" : {
  "headline": "Moving People",
  "img": {
    "src": "/images/hero_beyonce.jpg",
    "alt": "Beyonce"
  }
}

</code>
</pre>

<p>By overriding the default data, the <em>hero</em> headline now reads “Moving People” instead of “Lorem Ipsum”. And instead of pointing to a grayscale FPO (for placement only) hero image, we’re now pointing to a picture of Beyoncè located at <code>"/images/hero_beyonce.jpg"</code>.</p>

<p>This process of establishing defaults for dynamic data then replacing it with page-specific content continues for each section of the website. In addition to replacing simple strings like headings, we can also dynamically set variables to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, loop through an array of items, and more. We can even dramatically alter the UI with just a few changes to a JSON file, which we’ll talk about next!</p>

<h2 id="articulating-pattern-variations-with-pseudo-patterns">Articulating pattern variations with pseudo-patterns</h2>
<p>Historically designers working in static tools have had a tendancy to only design best-case scenarios. You know what I’m talking about. The user’s name is “Sara Smith” and always fits neatly on one line. Her profile picture looks like it was clipped out of a magazine. Her profile is completely filled out. The two columns of her profile content magically are exactly the same height.</p>

<p>Of course these best-case scenarios rarely, if ever, occur in the real world.</p>

<p><strong>In order to create more robust and resilient designs, we need to concurrently account for the best situations, the worst, and everything in between</strong>.</p>

<p>What if the user doesn’t upload a profile picture? What if the user has 87 items in their shopping cart? What if the product has 14 options? What if the blog post title contains 400 characters? Return user? First-time user? What if the article doesn’t have any comments? What if it has seven layers of nested comments? What if we need to display an urgent message on the dashboard?</p>

<p>Articulating these UI variations in a static design tool is an exercise in tediousness and redundancy, which may explain why they’re rarely designed. But if we want to create systems that address all the variables and realities of our content, we must take those “what if” questions into account.</p>

<p>How do we address all manner of UI variation without exhausting ourselves in the process? Pattern Lab’s <em><a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-pseudo-patterns.html">pseudo-pattern</a></em> feature allows us to articulate (sometimes wildly) different scenarios with just a few changes to our data.</p>

<p>Let’s say we’re making an app whose dashboard displays a list of project collaborators. The UI might look something like this:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/pseudo-pattern-normal.jpg" alt="A list of project collaboratos in our hypothetical app" />
	<figcaption>
	    A list of project collaboratos in our hypothetical app
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To create the dynamic content inside each of these blocks, we’ll define our list of collaborators as an array inside <code>dashboard.json</code>:</p>

<pre>
<code>

"collaborators" : [
  {
    "img": "/images/sample/avatar1.jpg",
    "name" : "Steve Boomshakalaka",
    "title" : "CIA"
  },
  {
    "img": "/images/sample/avatar2.jpg",
    "name" : "Gingersnap Jujubees-Daniels",
    "title" : "President of the Longest Company Name in the World Corporation, Global Division"
  },
  {
    "img": "/images/sample/avatar3.jpg",
    "name" : "Sarunus Marciulionis",
    "title" : "Golden State Warriors"
  },
  {
    "img": "/images/sample/avatar4.jpg",
    "name" : "Sara Smith",
    "title" : "Short Title"
  }
]

</code>
</pre>

<p>By default, our design assumes the user is a regular user and not an administrator, but what if we wanted to give administrators the ability to manage project collaborators from the dashboard? That UI might look something like this:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../images/content/pseudo-pattern-admin.jpg" alt="The administrator's dashboard UI introduces extra 'edit' and 'delete' actions." />
	<figcaption>
	    The administrator's dashboard UI introduces extra 'edit' and 'delete' actions.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In order to show additional admin “edit” and “delete” actions on the dashboard in Pattern Lab, we can create a pseudo-pattern, a new file in the <code>pages</code> folder that looks like this:</p>

<pre>
<code>

dashboard~admin.json

</code>
</pre>

<p>The tilde (<code>~</code>) symbol indicates a pseudo-pattern. <code>dashboard~admin.json</code> will inherit all the data contained in <code>dashboard.json</code>, but also gives us the opportunity to append or override additional data. That means the list of collaborators we defined earlier in <code>dashboard.json</code> is still available, but we can add additional data inside <code>dashboard~admin.json</code> like so:</p>

<pre>
<code>

"isAdmin" : true

</code>
</pre>

<p>We’re defining a variable called <code>isAdmin</code> and setting it to true. We can now use that to conditionally include the additional actions inside the block pattern.</p>

<pre>
<code>

\&lt;div class="block"\&gt;
  \&lt;img src="{{ img }}" alt="{{ name }}" /\&gt;
  \&lt;h3\&gt;{{ name }}\&lt;/h3\&gt;
  \&lt;h4\&gt;{{ title }}\&lt;/h4\&gt;
  {{# isAdmin }}
  {{&gt; molecules-block-actions }}
  {{/ isAdmin }}
\&lt;/div\&gt;

</code>
</pre>

<p>The first few lines are pulling in the <code>img</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>title</code> we defined in <code>dashboard.json</code>. But pay close attention to what’s wrapped in the <code>isAdmin</code> mustache section. What we’re saying here is “if <code>isAdmin</code> is set to <code>true</code>, include a molecule pattern called <code>block-actions</code>.” The <code>block-actions</code> pattern contains the “edit” and “delete” buttons, and will only display if <code>isAdmin</code> is set to <code>true</code> (or anything besides <code>false</code>). In our default <code>dashboard.json</code>, <code>isAdmin</code> isn’t set so the extra actions won’t display. In <code>dashboard~admin.json</code>, we’re setting <code>isAdmin</code> to <code>true</code> so the extra actions will display. You can extend this technique to dramatically alter the entire UI (like altering the primary navigation, showing additional panels on the dashboard, adding extra controls, etc) just by changing a single variable. Powerful stuff indeed.</p>

<p>Whew. If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You now know how to add and manipulate dynamic data in Pattern Lab. Pattern Lab’s ability to design with dynamic data provides some very crucial benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Creates a clear separation between structure and content</strong>. A pattern’s structure and its content very much influence each other, however resilient design systems strive to establish agnostic, flexible patterns that can contain a variety of content. Decoupling pattern structure and data allows us to keep things DRY (which again stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself) and make changes to content without affecting the pattern structure. Likewise, we’re able to make changes to a pattern without having to update every instance of that pattern simply because each instance contains different data. This separation results in huge savings in both time and effort. </li>
  <li><strong>Establishes an ad-hoc CMS</strong>. Establishing default and page-specific data serves as an ad-hoc content management system. As mentioned earlier, static design tools aren’t well equipped to handle dynamic data, but it’s also overkill to install Wordpress, Drupal, or some other CMS just to demonstrate UI variations. Pattern Lab strikes a balance as it allows teams to work with dynamic data but doesn’t require setting up any crazy MySQL databases.</li>
  <li><strong>Serves as a blueprint for backend developers</strong> responsible for integrating the frontend UI into a real content management system. Backend developers can look at the UI created in Pattern Lab, understand which bits are static and dynamic, then translate that into the backend system.</li>
  <li><strong>Allows writers, content people, designers, and other non-developers to contribute to the living, breathing design system</strong>. As a front-end developer, I can’t count the number of times I’ve had to fix typos, swap in new images, translate copy decks, and make other content-related edits to front-end code. It’s death by a million paper cuts, and I’m sure most developers would agree that making minor copy changes isn’t an effective use of a developer’s time. By separating structure and data, Pattern Lab enables non-developer team members to manage the content which in turn frees up developer time to focus on the structure of the design system.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve now covered Pattern Lab’s core functionality, but we’re not done yet! Next we’ll cover a few additional features that should be considered irrespective of what tool you use to create your pattern library.</p>

<h3 id="viewport-tools-for-flexible-patterns">Viewport tools for flexible patterns</h3>
<p>The myriad of devices now accessing the Web has forced designers to re-embrace the intrinsic fluidity of the medium. Thankfully, techniques like <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">responsive web design</a> allow us to create layouts that look and function beautifully on any screen.</p>

<p>It’s a no-brainer that we need to establish flexible UI patterns if we want to create responsive designs, but creating fluid patterns has additional advantages. The more fluid a UI component is, the more resilient and versatile it becomes. Imagine being able to take a component — let’s say a photo gallery slider — and plunk it anywhere we need it. Sometimes we may need it to be a full-bleed element occupying the entire viewport. Other times we may need to include it in the context of an article. And still other times we may want to include it in the sidebar. The dream is to build our components fluidly and they’ll adapt their styles and functionality to fit whatever containers we put them into.</p>

<p>Indeed, this is the promise of <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/container-queries-once-more-unto-the-breach">container queries</a>. Container queries let elements adapt themselves based on their parent container rather than the entire viewport, which is currently how we adapt elements using <code>@media</code> queries.  While still being developed as a native browser capability, container queries will allow us pattern-crazed designers and developers to easily create and deploy fluid UI systems.</p>

<p>So between responsive design, container queries, and good ol’-fashioned common sense, we now understand why it’s so imperative to create flexible UI patterns. But how do we do that? And how can our pattern library tools help us think and act flexibly? </p>

<p>Many early responsive design testing tools focused on viewing designs on popular mobile device widths, such as 320px (an iPhone 4 in portrait mode),  480px (an iPhone 4 in landscape mode), 768px (an iPad in portrait mode), and so on. But of course the Web is <em>much</em> more diverse than a “mobile” view, “tablet” view, and a “desktop” view. To help designers better consider the entire resolution spectrum when testing their responsive designs, I created a tool called <a href="http://bradfrost.com/demo/ish/">ish.</a>.</p>

<p>The tool is called “ish.” because selecting the small button results in a “small-ish” viewport. Selecting it again provides a different “small-ish” viewport. Selecting the medium button gives you a “medium-ish” viewport. And of course the large button results in a “large-ish” viewport. These randomized values help designers and developers better consider the entire resolution spectrum rather than a handful of popular device dimensions.</p>

<p>Ish. is baked into Pattern Lab, which means we can view our UIs and their underlying patterns across the entire resolution spectrum.</p>

<p>While ish. helps designers and developers uncover bugs along the viewport continuum, it’s more helpful as a client and colleague education tool. By building a device-agnostic viewport resizing tool directly into the pattern library, clients and colleagues can better appreciate the fact that their design system should look and function great no matter what the user’s viewport size is when interacting with the UI.</p>

<p>When considering the tool to choose to create your pattern library, you should consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate what patterns look like with real content inside  </li>
  <li>Demonstrate pattern variations</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>Ensure patterns work across all viewport sizes</li>
  <li>Demonstrate lineage</li>
  <li>Provide a clear bridge between the production </li>
</ul>
